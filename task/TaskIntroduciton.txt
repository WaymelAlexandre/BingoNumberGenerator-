Introduction
The Swinburne Bingo club has decided to update their practices and join the digital world.  
They have requested a program to be made that is able to draw the numbers for a Bingo game.  
They have already outsourced the creation of the bingo playing cards to some students.  
They only require the number drawing to be created.
However, the average age of the Swinburne Bingo club is 110 and they are uncomfortable with using anything more than a console program.

Tasks 
Write a program that draws bingo numbers. When the program runs, it will randomly choose a number between 1 and a user inputted upper limit. 
The program should start by requesting the upper limit from the user.
It should then go to a main menu that looks like:
 


1.	Upon starting the program should ask for the upper limit
 of numbers to be drawn
    i.	Program should not accept non-numeric input
    ii.	Program should not accept negative numbers

2.	Upon pressing “1” a new number is drawn
    i.	No duplicate numbers should be drawn
    ii.	No negative numbers should be drawn

3.	Upon pressing “2” all drawn numbers should be printed
    i.	Provide an option to print all numbers in the order that they were drawn
    ii.	Provide an option to print all numbers in numerical order

4.	Upon pressing “3” user is prompted to enter numbers one by one to check if they have been drawn

5.	Upon pressing “4” the program will exit

Extension (optional) (as above, but include):
    1.	Program will not accept non-numeric input and handle
    2.	Program will not accept negative numbers and handle
    3.	Create a new menu option that allows a list of numbers to be entered.  These will all be checked to see if they have been drawn.

Extra Extension (optional):
    1.	Create a new menu option that returns some statistics
    i.	Total of numbers drawn thus far
    ii.	Average of numbers drawn thus far

2.	Upon exiting the program will write the drawn numbers to a text file called “drawn_numbers.txt”
